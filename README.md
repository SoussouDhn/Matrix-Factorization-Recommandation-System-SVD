# Matrix-Factorization-Recommandation-System-SVD

This involves implementing 2 prediction models for a video content recommendation problem (74M individual). The predictions relate to the interest expressed by a client u in a content i. The recommendation is to offer the client a list of content ordered according to the estimated interest.
The models to be implemented are detailed in the article Koren08 namely:
Baseline Estimates;
SVD;

The project contains the following files:
Python file describing the compilation and formatting of training and test data;
Python file for the implementation and training of the Baseline Estimates model;
Python file for the implementation and training of the SVD model;
Parameter files associated with the two trained models;
Python file allowing to load and apply the 2 models on the test data.
